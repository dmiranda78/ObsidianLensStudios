    <h2>Where storms speak and shadows tell stories</h2>
    <p>Capturing the raw emotion of storm-lit skies, windswept landscapes, 
        and the quiet drama of nature's darker moods.
        Our lens is drawn to contrast, mystery and moments that most overlook.
        Whether it's the quiet before the storm or the electric chaos of a
        thunderstorm, we immortalize the poetry of the weather.
